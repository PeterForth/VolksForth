* New Editor

 The file =neditor.fb= contains an updated full screen editor for
 VolksForth. This version is based on the older fullscreen editor in
 =editor.fb= by Ulli Hoffmann and Klaus Schleisiek.

 The new editor works well in the =emu2= MS-DOS emulator and the
 keybindings are based on the GNU/EMACS editor (
 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ ).
